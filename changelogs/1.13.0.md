## Improvements

- **Implemented stability improvements**: Many components now support live updates starting from this version, allowing fixes to be applied immediately without requiring a new release.
- `Space Navigator`: Fixed an issue where file previews were not displaying. File previews now show both the name and description (visible on hover).
- Updated the list of available image generation models.
