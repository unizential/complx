- Fixed regressions across multiple plugins due to Perplexity's changes:
  - `Language Model Selector`
  - `Better Rewrite Dropdowns`
  - `Thread ToC`
  - `Thread Message TTS`

So what are the benefits of using Complexity's Model Selector instead of Perplexity's?

- Intuitive & unified selector for all models.
- Perform fast (non-Pro) searches with paid models (Sonnet 3.7, 4o, etc).
- Q: Why there is no "Auto" mode? Because it isn't even a thing. At the moment, "Auto" mode means the Sonar model (least capable).
