In order to **reduce initial loading time** and **improve performance**, some dependencies are now bundled with the extension instead of dynamically loaded over the internet. The download size of the extension is now approximately 1.4MB (nearly doubled). Source code is available for inspection [here](https://github.com/pnd280/complexity).
