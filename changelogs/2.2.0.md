## Changes

Model Selector plugins (LLM/Image) on home/threads/spaces are being deprecated. It is not recommended to use them unless you specifically need access to legacy/deprecated models.

A new model selector on Comet's sidecar (Assistant) will be available once the patching method that makes Comet allow extensions on Perplexity.ai is ready.
